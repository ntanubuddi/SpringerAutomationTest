# SpringerAutomationTest
I have used Java, Selenium and testNG for automation framework  with page object model .The reason for this approach is  Selenium is the most prominent tool in the field of automation testing and it is freeware, whereas Java, on the other hand, is the most heavily used programming language in todayâ€™s market. Both of these technologies together make a perfect combination for automation Testing. 

Page object model is very easy to maintain, helps with reusing the code .one can use the test code for one screen, and reuse it in another test case. There is no need to rewrite code, thus saving time and effort and it has good readability and reliability of scripts.

Test cases can be found at this location https://github.com/ntanubuddi/SpringerAutomationTest/tree/main/src/main/java/springerNature/SND/testScripts
